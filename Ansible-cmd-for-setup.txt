**Ansible setup on Centos**


**step1:- Try to ssh between 2 instance (ansible-mumbai = id_rsa)** 
	
	 mv /home/centos/ansible-mumbai.pem ./
     chmod 600 ansible-mumbai.pem
     ssh -i ansible-mumbai.pem centos@172.31.34.44
		
	eg:-try to run cmd through ssh 
	 ssh -i ansible-mumbai.pem centos@172.31.34.44 free
				 
**step2:- Setup ansible**

	**Python pkg required for ansible
	 yum install epel-release
	 
	** Now install ansible 
	 yum install ansible
	 vim /etc/ansible/hosts   
	 
	add host in hosts file 
	
		# This is the default ansible 'hosts' file.
		
		172.31.34.44 
		
		OR 
		
		[testserver]
			172.178.2.2
			172.178.2.3
			172.178.2.4
			
		# It should live in /etc/ansible/hosts
		
**Error can face due to.

			keep the hosts file in current dir 
			keep the id_rsa key at location or provid path in cmd 
			
			  ansible -i hosts all -u centos --private-key=/root/ansible-mumbai.pem -m shell -a uptime
			  
			  Run the cmd where both host and public are placed.
**Doing ,changes in ansible.cfg
	
			we can set fix path for inventory 
			inventory= /root/hosts
			host_keychecking= false   ---- for key verification 
			remote_user= centos
			private-key_file=/root/id_rsa
			
			ansible is specially used for Patching and patching is nothing kernal update.			
			according to project we can create different config file and hosts file rather doing changes in /etc/ansible/ansbile.cfg it will easy to manage.
			
			ansible -i hosts all -m shell -a hostname    -> hostname is module and run on shell
