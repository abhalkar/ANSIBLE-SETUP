**cmd used in ansible 

			/etc/ansible/hosts -> hosas/nodes on which automation as to perform
			/etc/ansible/ansible.conf -> config file 
			
			#ssh cmd use 
			
				*ssh -i ansible-mumbai.pem centos@172.31.34.44 free 
				
			*ansible -i host all -u centos --private-key=id_rsa -m shell -a uptime
			*ansible -i host all -u centos --private-key=id_rsa -m ping 
			
				i -> inventory   (static and dynamic)
				u -> username
				m -> module 
				a -> argument
				
				
				
**Modules in ansible
 
			Module is nothing but configuration on server 
			
			ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"
			ansible webservers -m ping

			# config need to make at time of setup in ansibile.cfg file
			
			inventory= /root/hosts
			host_keychecking= false   ---- for key verification 
			remote_user= centos
			private-key_file=/root/id_rsa
			
			ansible is specially used for Patching and patching is nothing kernal update.			
			according to project we can create different config file and hosts file rather doing changes in /etc/ansible/ansbile.cfg it will easy to manage.
			
			*ansible -i hosts all -m shell -a hostname    -> hostname is module and run on shell 
			
** Lets Write a playbook 

			Before this keep the ansible.cfg , hosts file in project.
